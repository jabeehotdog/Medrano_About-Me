This was strictly made as an attempt to follow this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldwlOzRvYOU&t=2344

I've deemed this undertaking a rewarding experience because of how much I've learned and unlearned in the process. Yes what I mostly did was follow through the tutorial. But in the end, I still managed to exercise some of my creative freedom.

Cheers to learning!
